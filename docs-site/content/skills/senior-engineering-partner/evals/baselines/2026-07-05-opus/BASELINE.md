# Recorded baseline — 2026-07-05, Opus, 45-scenario suite (skill v1.16.0, harness v2)

**The first baseline recorded under the fixture/tool-grant harness** (#81: fixture
workspaces, `Bash,Edit,Write` grants for claude-runner scenario runs, ordered tool-call
trail + workspace evidence to the judge, staged evals-free skill copy). **No earlier
baseline is comparable to this one** — including the four 2026-07-04 per-model sweeps —
because the earlier harness graded prose-only responses from a model that could not act
(the discontinuity note in [`../../README.md`](../../README.md) governs). The clearest
tell: the bare model now passes 11 scenarios where the 2026-07-02 prose-only bare run
passed 5 — a tool-granted bare model can do real work, so the skill is measured against
an honestly stronger floor.

Produced by `scripts/run-evals.py` at `main` commit `8d78511` (scenario + judge runs
`--model opus --judge-model opus`, `claude` CLI 2.1.197, `--jobs 2 --timeout 900`;
bare sweep first, then with-skill, sequentially). Committed JSONs are slim: statuses +
per-item judgments + judge reasons kept; `response`, `workspace_evidence`, and
`tool_trail` stripped — re-run the sweep to regenerate full transcripts under the
git-ignored `evals/results/`.

**One splice, disclosed:** `adr-must-name-overridden-discipline` errored in the
with-skill sweep — twice, reproducibly — on a judge-output *extraction* bug (the judge
appended prose containing a stray brace after its verdict JSON; the old greedy
first-`{`-to-last-`}` span failed to parse). The extraction was fixed to
`json.JSONDecoder().raw_decode` (first complete object wins; ships in the same PR as
this baseline), and the scenario was re-run once post-fix at the same skill content;
it judged **pass**, which is the entry recorded in `with-skill.json`. The fix touches
judge-output parsing only — no scenario behavior, no grading criteria.

## Headline

| Run | pass | partial | fail | error |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bare model (`--mode baseline`) | 11 | 22 | 12 | 0 |
| With the skill (`--mode with-skill`) | **29** | 16 | **0** | 0 |

**Per-scenario: 23 improved with the skill, 22 unchanged, 0 regressed — and the
with-skill fail column is zero for the first time on any recorded sweep.**

## The three sharpened scenarios (this session's targets)

| Scenario | Bare | With skill | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| tdd-regression-red-first | partial | **pass** | the old durable fail; red-first now proven in the tool trail |
| dependency-manifest-drift | partial | **pass** | incl. the image-scan blind-spot item this sweep |
| stale-diagram-on-behavior-change | partial | partial | every representation updated; the unnamed render-check remains the one standing content target |

## Harness caveats

- Scenario runs execute with `Bash,Edit,Write` on the invoking host (see the security
  note in `evals/README.md`); runs inherit the invoking environment's global agent
  context (user-level memory/hooks) — an open harness-isolation decision, disclosed in
  #81 and #79.
- Judge-model self-family bias remains an uncontrolled variable (same instrument across
  both modes, so the *gap* is unaffected).
- With-skill partials cluster on narration-depth items (naming a blind spot, naming an
  unrun check) rather than action items — the standing Claude-A content targets.
