# Recorded baseline — 2026-07-04, Sonnet 5, 45-scenario suite (skill v1.15.0)

The Sonnet leg of the 2026-07-04 per-model portability sweeps (siblings:
[`2026-07-04-haiku/`](../2026-07-04-haiku/BASELINE.md), Fable same day; the Opus
reference is [`2026-07-02-opus/`](../2026-07-02-opus/BASELINE.md), on the
then-38-scenario suite — deltas against it are directional, not like-for-like).
Produced by `scripts/run-evals.py` at branch commit `7c859f8` (scenario runs
`--model sonnet`, judge runs `--judge-model opus`; `claude` CLI 2.1.201, jobs=4);
scenario responses are stripped from the committed JSONs (statuses + per-item
judgments + judge reasons kept — re-run the sweep to regenerate full transcripts
locally under the git-ignored `evals/results/`).

## Headline

| Run | pass | partial | fail | error |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bare model (`--mode baseline`) | 6 | 27 | 12 | 0 |
| With the skill (`--mode with-skill`) | **16** | 22 | **7** | 0 |

**Per-scenario: 14 improved with the skill, 31 unchanged, 0 regressed.**

## What this baseline says about cross-model portability

Sonnet sits cleanly between Haiku and Opus: with-skill fails land at 7 (Haiku 16,
Opus 4 on the older suite), with zero regressions. The sharper signal is in *which*
fails persist: **four of Sonnet's seven stuck-fails are the same durable fails the
Opus baseline recorded** (adversarial-review-green-but-insufficient ·
dependency-manifest-drift · stale-diagram-on-behavior-change ·
tdd-regression-red-first) — those are **content/harness gaps the skill hasn't closed
on any model**, and they remain the sharpening targets. The remaining three
(badge-row-required-on-repo · graceful-shutdown-sigterm ·
stateless-for-horizontal-scale) are **model-capability gaps**: Opus clears them with
the same skill text. Reading across the three same-day sweeps, the with-skill quality
gradient tracks model tier even though the loaded content is identical.

## Harness caveats

Same harness as the Opus baseline: scenarios run in a bare scratch cwd (scenarios that
presume an existing tree read worse than real use); the `Skill` tool is disallowed and
the body is injected via `--append-system-prompt`. See the Haiku sibling for the
spec-first-vs-single-shot caveat (a skill-prompted clarifying question scores as
non-delivery in a one-turn judge).
