# Recorded baseline — 2026-07-04, Fable 5, 45-scenario suite (skill v1.15.0)

The Fable leg of the 2026-07-04 per-model portability sweeps (siblings:
[`2026-07-04-sonnet/`](../2026-07-04-sonnet/BASELINE.md),
[`2026-07-04-haiku/`](../2026-07-04-haiku/BASELINE.md); the Opus reference is
[`2026-07-02-opus/`](../2026-07-02-opus/BASELINE.md), on the then-38-scenario suite —
deltas against it are directional, not like-for-like). Produced by
`scripts/run-evals.py` at branch commit `7c859f8` (scenario runs `--model fable`,
judge runs `--judge-model opus`; `claude` CLI 2.1.201, jobs=3); scenario responses are
stripped from the committed JSONs (statuses + per-item judgments + judge reasons kept —
re-run the sweep to regenerate full transcripts locally under the git-ignored
`evals/results/`).

**One splice, disclosed:** `rls-cross-tenant-deny` hit the harness's default 600s
timeout in the with-skill sweep (`TimeoutExpired`, not a model verdict) and was re-run
once at `--timeout 1200` at the same commit; it completed in 803s and judged
**partial**, which is the entry recorded in `with-skill.json`. The timeout is itself a
finding: with the full skill loaded, Fable routinely works much longer per task —
sweeps on deep-reasoning models should set `--timeout` above the 600s default.

## Headline

| Run | pass | partial | fail | error |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bare model (`--mode baseline`) | 8 | 28 | 9 | 0 |
| With the skill (`--mode with-skill`) | **28** | 14 | **3** | 0 |

**Per-scenario: 22 improved with the skill, 23 unchanged, 0 regressed.**

## What this baseline says about cross-model portability

Fable records the strongest profile of any swept model on both curves: the best bare
baseline (fail 9) *and* the best with-skill result (pass 28, fail 3) — the skill's
value does not vanish up-model; it compounds (22 scenarios improved, the most of any
sweep, largely partial→pass sharpening rather than fail rescues). The three remaining
fails are precisely the **shared durable core** every model fails with the skill
loaded — dependency-manifest-drift, stale-diagram-on-behavior-change,
tdd-regression-red-first — which the Opus baseline already named as content/harness
gaps (two carry its bare-cwd caveat). Notably, adversarial-review-green-but-insufficient
— durably failed on Opus and Haiku — reaches partial here. Cross-model conclusion from
the four recorded sweeps: with identical skill text, with-skill fails run 16 (Haiku 4.5)
→ 7 (Sonnet 5) → 4 (Opus 4.8, older suite) → 3 (Fable 5) — the skill loads everywhere,
and how much of it gets *enforced* tracks model tier.

## Harness caveats

Same harness as the Opus baseline: scenarios run in a bare scratch cwd (scenarios that
presume an existing tree read worse than real use — stale-diagram and tdd-regression
carry this caveat); the `Skill` tool is disallowed and the body is injected via
`--append-system-prompt`. Fable-specific: with-skill runs are markedly slower (the 803s
scenario above; several others exceeded 300s) — budget `--timeout` accordingly. See the
Haiku sibling for the spec-first-vs-single-shot caveat.
