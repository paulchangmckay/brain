<!-- Contributor checklist — see CONTRIBUTING.md. Tick what applies. -->
- [ ] Branch is rebased on the latest `main`; PR title is a Conventional Commit.
- [ ] Small and single-purpose (one change per PR).
- [ ] Docs updated in **this** PR — README / the relevant `references/*.md` / any diagram or step-list the change touches. Do **not** hand-edit the `Version` or `CHANGELOG.md`: [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) derives both from the Conventional-Commit PR title (see `MAINTAINERS.md` → *Cutting a release*).
- [ ] `bash scripts/leakage-guard.sh` and `bash scripts/render-diagrams.sh` pass locally (and any Mermaid I touched renders).
- [ ] No host/employer/personal identifiers added to the universal core (those live in a private `references/my-environment.md`).
- [ ] If I added or changed a discipline, an `evals/` scenario guards it.
- [ ] I self-reviewed the diff (correctness, scope, security).
