# leakage-guard.sh — fail if any environment-specific / personal identifier leaks into the
# public skill. The universal core must stay universal; anything specific belongs in your
# (un-committed) references/my-environment.md.
#
# TWO-TIER denylist, so the PUBLIC repo never has to publish your personal identifiers in
# order to block them:
#   Tier 1 — GENERIC class-patterns below (a CGNAT/Tailscale IP range, [[wikilinks]]). These
#            name nothing personal, so they ship in this public file and run in CI.
#   Tier 2 — your LITERAL identifiers (hostnames, employer, repo/project names, private IPs)
#            live in references/leakage-denylist.local — an UN-COMMITTED file created from
#            leakage-denylist.local.template and sourced here if present. So your fingerprints
#            guard the tree LOCALLY without ever being written into the public repo or its
#            history. (CI, which has no .local file, enforces only the generic Tier-1 patterns;
#            the local pre-PR run is the primary gate — see CONTRIBUTING.md.)
#
# Run locally before a PR (Tier 1 + Tier 2) and as a CI check (Tier 1 only). Exits non-zero
# (printing every hit) if a denylisted identifier appears anywhere in the tracked tree.
#
# Allowed by design: author attribution ("Brian Greenberg" / the website URL) in README.md and
# SKILL.md's metadata table — matched out below. references/my-environment.md and
# references/leakage-denylist.local are never scanned (the latter has a non-scanned extension).
