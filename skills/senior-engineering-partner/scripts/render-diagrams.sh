# render-diagrams.sh — render-check every ```mermaid block in the given Markdown files.
#
# An un-rendered Mermaid block degrades to a red "Unable to render" box for every reader —
# a broken deliverable, like a failing test (SKILL.md "Diagrams & visual documentation",
# v5.3/v5.7). This is the house pattern behind the REQUIRED `docs-render` status check:
# one self-contained script, run verbatim locally (pre-commit) AND in CI. It fails on the
# first block that does not render.
#
# Usage:   scripts/render-diagrams.sh FILE.md [FILE2.md ...]
#          scripts/render-diagrams.sh $(git ls-files '*.md')
#
# Rendering uses the mermaid-cli container so no host toolchain is needed.
#   IMPORTANT: MMDC_IMAGE is pinned to a DIGEST (image@sha256:...), not a moving tag, so the gate
#   is reproducible. The default below is a published mermaid-cli digest (tag 11.x); override it
#   via the MMDC_IMAGE env var. When you bump it, re-pin to the exact digest `docker pull` reports
#   for the new tag — never a fabricated one.
