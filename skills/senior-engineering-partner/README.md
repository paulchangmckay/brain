# senior-engineering-partner

Last updated: 2026-06-30 07:40 PM CDT

A custom Claude Code skill: a strict **code reviewer, pair programmer, debugger, and mentor** for
Python, Bash, Google Apps Script, and JavaScript. It encodes a security-first,
phase-aware engineering discipline — and an enforced **spec → plan → TDD → verify** workflow —
as reusable instructions that activate via
`/senior-engineering-partner` (or auto-activate when a task matches its description) in
any Claude Code session.

> This README documents the skill's *architecture* — how it is organized and maintained.
> The skill's actual instructions live in [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md); the deep, per-topic
> standards live in [`references/`](references/).

## What it is

A single skill that does the heavy lifting of senior engineering work — design, write,
test, review, debug, and document code — calibrated to an intermediate Python/Bash developer.
Three ideas run through everything:

- **Phase-aware rigor, with a security floor that never moves.** Match effort to the
  project's phase (prototype → MVP → production), but never relax the
  secrets/injection/validation/isolation/authentication fundamentals. *Cheap ≠ insecure.*
- **Deterministic-first, anti-hallucination discipline.** Verify before asserting (claims
  about the environment come from a tool run *this turn*), never invent flags/paths/APIs,
  and mechanize anything checkable (counting, parsing, regex, transforms) in a script
  rather than reasoning it out token-by-token.
- **An enforced workflow, not just standards.** The skill doesn't only say what good looks
  like — it drives the loop that produces it: **spec-first** (agree what you're building
  before building it) → **plan** in verifiable steps → **tier-aware iron-law TDD** →
  **verify-before-done self-review**. Depth scales with the rigor tier; the loop does not.

---

## What it governs

The disciplines are stack-agnostic, but they bind to concrete tooling. At a glance, what the skill
carries standards for:

- **Languages:** Python · Bash · Google Apps Script · JavaScript / TypeScript
- **Source control & CI/CD:** GitHub · GitHub Actions · branch protection / rulesets · supply-chain gates (SBOM · SLSA · signing)
- **Cloud & infra:** GCP / Cloud Run · Docker · Kubernetes · Terraform (IaC)
- **Data:** Postgres / Supabase (RLS) · BigQuery · SQLite · caching
- **App layer:** FastAPI / Python web APIs · front-end & browser security · responsive, accessible (WCAG 2.2 AA) UI
- **Security & standards:** the security floor (secrets · injection · input validation · isolation · least privilege) · NIST CSF 2.0 + SSDF · OWASP Top 10 / **API Top 10** / **LLM Top 10** · STRIDE · SOC 2 · Well-Architected · PCI-DSS scope
- **Reliability & ops:** resilience engineering · disaster recovery & business continuity · scalability / system design · observability + incident response (DORA · SLOs)
- **Platform-specific:** macOS app bundles / TCC · local & agentic AI tooling · diagrams-as-code (Mermaid)

Each binds to a deep, **read-on-demand** reference (see the [catalog](#reference-catalog) below); your
concrete hosts, projects, and stack live only in the private, un-committed `references/my-environment.md`.

---

## Architecture

The skill is a **stack-agnostic universal core** (`SKILL.md`, always loaded) plus a
**swappable environment profile** and a library of deep per-topic references read **on
demand** (progressive disclosure — Claude reads a reference only when its trigger
paragraph in `SKILL.md` says the work is relevant). Forking the skill for a different
environment is a matter of replacing one file (`references/my-environment.md`).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    U["/senior-engineering-partner"] --> C
    C["SKILL.md — universal core<br/>modes · epistemic discipline · engineering workflow · rigor ladder<br/>security floor · coding standards · toolchain triggers"]
    C -->|"progressive disclosure: read a reference only when relevant"| R[(references/)]
    C -.->|"shipped helpers"| K["scripts/ (audit · render-diagrams · self-review)<br/>evals/ (27 regression scenarios)"]
    R --> P["Environment profile<br/>my-environment.md (swap to re-home the skill)"]
    R --> W["Engineering process (4)<br/>engineering-workflow · debugging · audit-report-format · standards-authoring"]
    R --> S["Security, privacy and compliance (6)"]
    R --> T["Testing and QA (2)"]
    R --> I["Cloud, infra and ops (9) + data (2)"]
    R --> A["App toolchains, CI and collaboration (11)"]
    R --> X["UI, a11y, diagrams, AI tooling, macOS (4)"]
```

`SKILL.md` carries the rules that must always be in context (the modes, the security
floor, the rigor ladder, the coding/documentation/logging/SCM standards, and a short
trigger paragraph per toolchain). Each trigger paragraph states the non-negotiables and
points at the reference to **read before** doing related work — so the expensive detail
is loaded only when it earns its place in the context window.

---

## Modes & triggers

Behavior changes on a leading trigger word; with no trigger, it defaults to pair
programming.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    P[User prompt] --> Q{Leading trigger word?}
    Q -->|"REVIEW:"| R["Strict senior code reviewer<br/>critique rigorously, then deliver the refactor"]
    Q -->|"EXPLAIN:"| E["Patient mentor<br/>teach the why, not just a copy-paste answer"]
    Q -->|"MVP: / PROTOTYPE:"| M["Lean-but-safe builder<br/>Tier 0/1, defer heavy gates, never the floor"]
    Q -->|"DEBUG:"| G["Systematic debugger<br/>reproduce, isolate, fix root cause, prove with a red-first test"]
    Q -->|none| D["Collaborative pair programmer (default)<br/>clean, tested, documented, production-ready code"]
```

| Trigger | Mode | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | **Pair programmer** | Do the work — production-ready code with tests + docs, concise explanation. |
| `REVIEW:` | **Strict reviewer** | Critique security/edge-cases/perf/best-practices first, then always deliver the refactored version. |
| `EXPLAIN:` | **Mentor** | Educate step-by-step, calibrate to an intermediate dev, prioritize understanding. |
| `MVP:` / `PROTOTYPE:` | **Lean-but-safe builder** | Leanest version that still clears the security floor; defer heavy gates as explicit `TODO`s with promotion triggers. |
| `DEBUG:` | **Systematic debugger** | Reproduce → hypothesize → isolate/bisect → fix the root cause (not the symptom) → prove with a regression test seen to fail red first. |

---

## The rigor ladder

Effort scales with project phase; the **security/CIA floor holds at every tier**. Only
verification depth, redundancy, and operational maturity scale.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    T0["Tier 0 — Prototype<br/>throwaway, never real tenant data"]
    T1["Tier 1 — MVP / early product<br/>critical-path tests, basic CI, secrets manager, authn, backups"]
    T2["Tier 2 — Production / commercial / multi-tenant<br/>full strict posture, every merge-blocking gate"]
    Floor["Security / CIA floor — CONSTANT at every tier<br/>no hardcoded secrets · validate inputs · no injection · isolated env · authn · vetted deps"]
    T0 -->|"real users / small scale"| T1
    T1 -->|"customers · money · multi-tenant · PII · 2nd contributor · public exposure"| T2
    Floor -.underpins.-> T0
    Floor -.underpins.-> T1
    Floor -.underpins.-> T2
```

Crossing any promotion trigger (real customer/tenant data, money changing hands,
multi-tenant isolation, regulated/PII data, a second contributor, public internet
exposure) re-rates the project up a tier — it is not optional polish.

## Shipped helpers & evals

Beyond the always-loaded core and the read-on-demand references, the skill ships two
support directories:

- **`scripts/`** — the utility scripts the disciplines reference, shipped so they're
  *executed*, not regenerated: `audit.sh` (manifest-level dependency-audit gate),
  `render-diagrams.sh` (the `docs-render` Mermaid render-check), and `self-review.md` (the
  verify-before-done checklist). Pin `render-diagrams.sh`'s `MMDC_IMAGE` to a digest before
  relying on it.
- **`evals/`** — a regression suite. Each `scenarios/*.json` encodes a real miss from the
  changelog as a checkable expectation, in Anthropic's evaluation shape. `evals/README.md`
  documents the baseline-then-iterate (Claude-A authors / Claude-B tests) loop. **Add or
  extend a scenario whenever a new changelog entry is written from a real miss** — a lesson
  without a guarding eval can silently regress.

---

## Install

Claude Code loads skills from `~/.claude/skills/`. Install by cloning this repo into that
directory under the skill's own name:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bjgreenberg/senior-engineering-partner \
  ~/.claude/skills/senior-engineering-partner
```

Then **customize it for your environment** (next section) and invoke it with
`/senior-engineering-partner` (optionally prefixed with a mode trigger word). The universal
core works out of the box against the assumed baseline (macOS, Bash, GitHub, a secret
manager, a scale-to-zero cloud target); the profile is what makes its guidance specific to
*you*.

## Customize for your environment (`my-environment.md`)

The core is deliberately **stack-agnostic** — it carries no hosts, repos, employer, or
machine specifics. Those live in one file you create from the shipped template:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/senior-engineering-partner
cp references/my-environment.template.md references/my-environment.md
$EDITOR references/my-environment.md   # fill in your stack/hosts/Git standards/reference app
```

`references/my-environment.md` is `.gitignore`d, so your real details are never committed —
you can keep your fork's core in sync with this repo (`git pull`) without ever exposing your
profile. The core instructs the assistant to **read `my-environment.md` early and for any
environment-specific claim**, so the more complete it is, the more grounded the guidance.

## Maintaining / contributing

- **Versioning + releases are automated** with
  [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please): it reads the Conventional
  Commits on `main`, opens a release PR that bumps the `Version` in `SKILL.md`'s metadata table
  and prepends the entry to [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). A maintainer enriches that entry's
  narrative, then cuts the **signed** tag + GitHub Release — the repo's `tag-protection` ruleset
  requires signed tags, so that final step is a deliberate manual one (see
  [`MAINTAINERS.md`](MAINTAINERS.md) → *Cutting a release*). The skill's own documentation
  discipline, applied to itself.
- **Diagrams are render-checked before commit:** a Mermaid block that fails to render is a
  broken deliverable. Validate with GitHub/VS Code preview, mermaid.live, or
  `@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` (`mmdc`) — see
  [`references/diagrams-and-visual-docs.md`](references/diagrams-and-visual-docs.md). CI
  runs `scripts/render-diagrams.sh` (the `docs-render` gate) on every PR.
- **No environment-specific leakage in the core:** a `leakage-guard` check greps the tree against
  a denylist of personal/host/repo identifiers. It's **two-tier**: generic class-patterns (a
  CGNAT/Tailscale IP range, Obsidian-style wiki-links) ship in `scripts/leakage-guard.sh` and run in CI,
  while your *literal* identifiers live in an un-committed `references/leakage-denylist.local`
  (created from its `.template`) so the public repo never has to publish them to block them. Keep
  the universal core universal; anything specific belongs in your (un-committed) `my-environment.md`.
- **Add or extend an `evals/` scenario** whenever you add a load-bearing rule — a lesson
  without a guarding eval can silently regress.
