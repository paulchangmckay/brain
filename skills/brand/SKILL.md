# Brand Skill — Paul McKay Personal Brand

You are the brand gate. No output is created before this skill runs.

## What To Do

1. **Identify the output type** from the user's request:
   - Presentation / Slides / Deck / PPTX
   - PDF / One-Pager
   - Long-Form Document / Proposal / PRD
   - Email / Newsletter
   - Business Card
   - LinkedIn / Social Post
   - Data Visualization (standalone chart or dashboard)
   - Process Flow / Diagram

2. **Read the brand guide:**
   ```
   ~/.claude/brand/brand-guide.md
   ```

3. **Navigate to the matching `## Format:` section** for the output type identified in step 1. If multiple output types are involved, cover all relevant sections.

4. **Output a Brand Spec Card** — a compact, formatted block with the exact values Claude must use for this output. Use this structure:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
BRAND SPEC CARD — [Output Type]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
COLORS
  Background:     [value]
  Primary text:   Charcoal #2a2a28
  Accent/CTA:     Taupe #6b5b54
  Secondary:      [Slate #5a7a8a OR Khaki #a89980 — pick one]
  Section fill:   Linen #f5f2ed (only if needed)

TYPOGRAPHY
  Headline:       Poppins [weight], [size]
  Subhead:        Poppins [weight], [size]
  Body:           Lora 400, [size], line-height [value]

LAYOUT
  Margins:        [value]
  Grid:           [8px or 16px]
  White space:    [guidance]

VOICE
  Tone:           [Formal / Supportive / Decisive — per context]
  Check:          "Would an executive take this seriously?"

MARK
  Required:       ◆ minimum 24px, clear space 1 mark-width all sides
  Color:          Taupe #6b5b54 (primary) or Charcoal (monochrome)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

5. **Confirm brand gate is satisfied** with this line:
   > ✓ Brand gate cleared. Proceeding to create [output type].

6. **Then proceed** to create the output using the specs from the Brand Spec Card.

## Hard Rules — Never Violate

- Only 6 colors exist: `#2a2a28`, `#6b5b54`, `#f5f2ed`, `#fafaf8`, `#5a7a8a`, `#a89980`
- Only 2 typefaces: Poppins (headings) and Lora (body)
- Mark minimum size: 24px always
- No 3D charts, drop shadows, or decorative effects on data viz
- No casual language in external-facing outputs
- One accent color per document/deck — not both Slate and Taupe
- One idea per slide maximum
- Margins: generous (1" for print/PDF)

## When Invoked Explicitly (/brand)

If the user types `/brand` without specifying an output type, ask:

> "What output type are we creating? (e.g., presentation, PDF, proposal, email, social post, diagram)"

Then deliver the Brand Spec Card for that format.

## Common Mistake Check

Before confirming brand gate, quickly scan for these 7 anti-patterns and flag if relevant:
1. Too many colors (more than 3 from the palette in one piece)
2. Casual language in formal context
3. Inconsistent typography hierarchy
4. Data viz with decorative effects
5. Crowded slides / dense text blocks
6. Palette exception "just this once"
7. Mark too small or missing
